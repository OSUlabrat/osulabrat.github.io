  My name is Eric Yeung. Thanks for taking the time to visit my site! First and foremost, I am a problem solver.
  No problem is too small and no solution is too big. I love to learn, build and grow. Extra time always transforms into another extra project or furthering my understanding of new technology. 
  So with that in mind, feel free to check out what I do with my time. LET'S GO BUCKS!
